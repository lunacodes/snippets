# Documentation Suggestions

Note from [“Git hook[ed]” on images & up your documentation game - Veronica Hanus (PyCon AU 2019)](https://youtu.be/alej-1P411A) :

Save screenshot in Git & Connect to Git Issue, so you can see it on GitHub

Screenshot Diffing:

- Sketches Pages
- Abstract's Compare Mode - "Git for design"
- As helpful docs, but more adorable

Automating image diffing:

- Puppeteer or Cypress-match-screen to automate screenshots
- Git hooks
- Terminal prompt for you by hand

Make your own!

- Puppeteer/Selenium/Web Driver for screenshots taken at every change
- Hand-created screenshots checked into version control
- Git Large File Storage or store files outside Git to accomadate the file accumulation

Existing Tools:

- Percy - visual testing
- Editor plugins that help you visualize the colors on your site
- Abstract/Zeplin/Sketch
- `Git-difftool` shows changes from common diffing tools
- `Git image view` modes `swipe` & `compare` - your own personal, modern Blink comparator
